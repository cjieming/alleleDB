Personal genome construction
*vcf2phased
-this helper script preprocesses the VCF file by randomly phasing ALL unphased genotypes in a VCF file, so that we can make these 'randomized' genotypes consistent to give 'reproducible' genomes
-the output feeds into vcf2diploid from AlleleSeq pipeline


Allele-specific calculation
*calc.overdispersion.R
-given output counts.txt from AlleleSeq, this R script calculates the overdispersion of the dataset

*alleleseq.betabinomial.R
-given the output counts.txt from AlleleSeq and the overdispersion calculated from above, this R script outputs the allele-specific SNVs that satisfy the FDR cutoff based on a beta-binomial test.
